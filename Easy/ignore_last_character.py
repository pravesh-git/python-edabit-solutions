"""
This is a list of single characters with an unwanted character at the end:

["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "!", "\0"]
You could also just type "Hello!" when initializing a variable, creating the string "Hello!"

Create a function that will return a string by combining the given character list, not including the unwanted final character.

Examples
cpp_txt(["H", "i", "!", "\0"]) ➞ "Hi!"

cpp_txt(["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "!", "\0"]) ➞ "Hello!"

cpp_txt(["J", "A", "V", "a", "\0"]) ➞ "JAVa"
Notes
This is a translation of a C++ challenge and is trivial in Python, 
but perhaps it will be helpful to someone out there. (No challenge is trivial until you know how to solve it :)
